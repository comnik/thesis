\subsubsection{Problem}

Throughout this work we have seen the many challenges of implementing
complex, high-arity joins. At the same time, we have also seen their
tremendous power as enablers for flexible data modeling, as well as
foundation on which the entire expressive range of a language like
Datalog can be implemented efficently.

We have also touched on [@TODO] features such as user-controlled query
parameters and queries across a specific range of time, which treat
control inputs and configuration parameters as data and which are then
in turn efficently implemented via the join primitives.

In this scenario we will focus on a critical property of distributed
joins in general, and of the latter "control joins" in particular:
skew.

Skew problems arise in distributed, data-parallel processing, whenever
inputs are either not distributed evenly across homogeneous workers,
or not distributed according to the varying capacities of
heterogeneous workers.

For stateless operators such as \texttt{map} or \texttt{filter}, we
can always randomly shuffle the data amongst workers, to ensure a
uniform distribution. This is not possible for operators that depend
on state for each key. In particular, an operator such as
\texttt{join} must be certain it will see all inputs for a key $k$ on
a specific worker, if it has seen any input for $k$ on that
worker. Otherwise we might miss results.

\subsection{Examples}

@TODO MatchAV, MatchEA, Filter vs Lookup vs Join

@TODO control collection

@TODO general trade-off with arrangements

Categorical data is the cornerstone of modern data science. Predictive
models both consume and serve as natural input sources of
\emph{features} such as \texttt{:transaction/fraudulent?} or
\texttt{:person/bot?}.

While features can be modelled as boolean attributes, useful features
should be highly discriminating and thus apply to very small subsets
of entities with little overlap. Explicitely storing false values to
indicate absence of a feature is therefore a very storage-inefficient
approach. For this reason, a value of true is often meant to indicate
the presence of the feature on the given entity, while any entity not
contained in the relation is assumed to not posses the feature.

Modeling categorical features via binary relations in this way leads
to an extremely skewed distribution of values. In particular a reverse
index on any such attribute (as required by the worst-case optimal
join algorithm) would be entirely stored on a single worker.

\subsection{Remedies}

\cite{ammar2018distributed} propose a skew resilient version of their
\emph{Delta-BiGJoin} algorithm. Its implementation and adaption to 3DF
are beyond the scope of this work.
