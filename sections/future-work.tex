A hybrid cost-based approach in \cite{mhedhbi2019optimizing} shows
promising results.

\subsection{Datalog Evaluation Strategies}

At its heart (and mostly thanks to Differential's incremental
computation model), 3DF uses a semi-naive, bottom-up evaluation
strategy. Over the past decades, many more sophisticated Datalog
evaluation strategies have been developed
(e.g. \cite{tekle2011more}). More work is needed to understand how
strategies such as the magic-set transform or subsumptive tabling
translate into the incremental dataflow model, and to what extent they
overlap with worst-case optimal join evaluation.

\subsection{Static Optimizations}

The finer-grained language of bindings described in chapter
\ref{implementation}, and in particular the use of the
\texttt{constant} binding surfaced interesting opportunities for
static optimizations. For example, by moving conjunctive clauses into
disjunctions (using DeMorgan's law), we at times identified entire
branches that couldn't possibly produce results, due to conflicting
constant bindings.
