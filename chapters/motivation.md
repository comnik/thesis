# Introduction and Motivation

As more and more industries adopt data-driven decision-making and
companies are increasingly looking to provide digital services, the
capability to perform diverse complex analyses on potentially
unbounded data streams is becoming a critical competitive advantage.

While recent, purpose-built stream processing systems can meet the
very high throughputs and near real-time latencies demanded, we are
interested in the interactive interfaces, higher-level query
languages, and automatic optimisation neccessary to support real-world
use-cases.

Understanding overall system performance in such a dynamic environment
warrants re-visiting established practices in query optimisation.

It should be stressed that the primary goal of the project is not to
produce the single best performing dataflow for a specific
computation, but rather to gain insight and understanding into how a
modern dataflow system can support a wide range of non-trivial queries
in demanding interactive environments while retaining its overall
performance characteristics.
